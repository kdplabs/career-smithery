# PDF Generation Error Fix

## Problem
Existing users were experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to download resume PDFs, while new users had no issues. The error occurred at the `/api/generate-resume-pdf` endpoint.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:

1. **Data Format Inconsistency**: Existing users' resume data stored in the database could be in different formats:
   - Some data might be stored as stringified JSON
   - Some fields might be missing or have unexpected structures
   - Arrays might not be properly initialized

2. **Missing Data Validation**: The API endpoint didn't validate or normalize the incoming data before passing it to Handlebars templates, causing template rendering failures when required fields were missing or malformed.

3. **Insufficient Error Logging**: The original error messages didn't provide enough detail to diagnose the specific data structure issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Parsing (`generate-resume-pdf.js`)
Added automatic JSON parsing for stringified data:
```javascript
// Handle case where resumeData might be a stringified JSON
if (typeof resumeData === 'string') {
  try {
    resumeData = JSON.parse(resumeData);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Failed to parse resumeData string:', e);
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 400,
      statusMessage: 'Invalid resume data format',
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Data Normalization Function
Created a `normalizeResumeData()` function that ensures all required fields exist with proper default values:
- Validates and normalizes `personalInfo` fields
- Ensures arrays (`workExperience`, `education`, `skills`, etc.) are properly initialized
- Provides safe defaults for all optional fields
- Prevents template rendering errors from missing data

### 3. Improved Error Logging
Enhanced error messages to include:
- Full error stack traces
- Detailed data structure logging
- Specific error messages indicating what went wrong

### 4. Applied Same Fixes to Cover Letter Generation
Applied identical fixes to `generate-cover-letter-pdf.js` to prevent similar issues.

## Files Modified

1. `/server/api/generate-resume-pdf.js`
   - Added `normalizeResumeData()` helper function
   - Added JSON string parsing
   - Added data validation
   - Enhanced error logging

2. `/server/api/generate-cover-letter-pdf.js`
   - Added JSON string parsing for both cover letter and resume data
   - Enhanced error logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with existing user data**: Try downloading resumes for users who have data stored before this fix
2. **Test with new users**: Ensure new user flow still works correctly
3. **Monitor server logs**: Check for any detailed error messages that might indicate remaining data structure issues
4. **Test all templates**: Verify classic, modern, and minimal templates all work correctly
5. **Test cover letter generation**: Ensure cover letter PDFs also download successfully

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Consistent Data Storage**: Ensure all data is stored in the database as proper JSON objects, not stringified
2. **Schema Validation**: Consider adding Zod or similar schema validation for resume data
3. **Migration Script**: Consider creating a migration to normalize existing user data in the database
4. **Client-Side Validation**: Add validation on the client side before sending data to the API

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Server error logs for any PDF generation failures
- User reports of download issues
- Success/failure rates of PDF downloads by user cohort (new vs existing)
