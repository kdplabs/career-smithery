## Why Traditional Methods Don't Work Anymore {#why-traditional}

The job market has fundamentally changed. Here's what the data shows:

::StatsGrid{:stats='[
  { value: "75%", label: "ATS Rejection Rate", description: "Of resumes never reach human reviewers" },
  { value: "3-5 sec", label: "Initial Screen Time", description: "Average time recruiters spend on first review" },
  { value: "250+", label: "Applications Per Job", description: "Average number of applicants per posting" }
]' columns="3"}

::CalloutBox{type="warning" title="Reality Check"}
Sending the same generic resume to hundreds of jobs is no longer an effective strategy. You need to be smarter, not just work harder.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid {#mistakes}

Learn from others' mistakes and avoid these common pitfalls:

::AccordionList{:items='[
  { 
    title: "Applying to Everything Without Strategy", 
    content: "Casting a wide net might seem logical, but it leads to burnout and poor results. Instead, focus on 10-15 ideal positions and give each application your full attention. Quality applications to the right roles will yield far better results than hundreds of generic ones."
  },
  { 
    title: "Ignoring ATS Optimization", 
    content: "75% of resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems before a human ever sees them. Use simple formatting, include relevant keywords from the job description, and avoid graphics or complex layouts. Our AI Resume Builder automatically handles this for you."
  },
  { 
    title: "Neglecting Your Network", 
    content: "80% of jobs are filled through networking, yet most job seekers focus solely on online applications. Start building relationships now - attend industry events, engage on LinkedIn, and request informational interviews. Your network is your net worth in the job market."
  },
  { 
    title: "Not Following Up", 
    content: "Many candidates apply and then wait passively. Following up shows initiative and keeps you top of mind. Send a polite follow-up email one week after applying, and leverage any connections at the company to inquire about your application status."
  },
  { 
    title: "Having a Weak Online Presence", 
    content: "Recruiters will Google you. Make sure your LinkedIn profile is complete and professional, clean up your social media, and consider creating a personal website or portfolio. Your online presence is often your first impression."
  },
  { 
    title: "Focusing Only on Skills, Not Results", 
    content: "Don\'t just list what you did - showcase the impact you made. Use numbers and metrics wherever possible. \'Increased sales by 35%\' is much more powerful than \'Responsible for sales.\'"
